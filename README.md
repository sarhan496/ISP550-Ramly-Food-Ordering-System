Hosting
We use latest Cloud Computing Services | Microsoft Azure.
What is Azure?
Azure is Microsoft's cloud platform, exactly as Google and Amazon. It's a Microsoft resource platform. To put up a large server, we'll need plenty of money, time, and space. Microsoft Azure helps in these instances. Virtual machines, quick data processing, analytical and monitoring tools, etc. will simplify our job. Azure's pricing is straightforward and affordable. Pay-as-you-go implies you only pay for what you use.
